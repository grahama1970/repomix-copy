  "response": "This script is an AppleScript meant to be run using Raycast, a productivity tool for macOS. The purpose of the script is to copy all URLs from the currently active window in Safari to the clipboard. \n\nHereâ€™s a breakdown of the script's functionality:\n\n1. **Script Declaration**: It starts with a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/osascript`), indicating that it should be executed using the AppleScript interpreter.\n  \n2. **Metadata Annotations**: The script contains several metadata annotations recognized by Raycast, which include:\n   - `schemaVersion`: Version of the schema being followed.\n   - `title`: Name of the script as displayed in Raycast.\n   - `mode`: Specifies how the script will behave (in this case, \"silent\" meaning no UI or user prompts).\n   - `packageName`: Categorizes the script under the name \"Safari\".\n   - `icon`: An optional visual identifier for the script.\n   - `description`: Brief description of what the script does.\n   - `author` and `authorURL`: Information about the creator of the script.\n\n3. **Main Logic**:\n   - The script interacts with the Safari application, specifically targeting the frontmost window.\n   - It checks if the front window has any documents (tabs) open.\n   - It retrieves the URLs of the tabs in that front window and sets them as a text item, separated by line breaks (using the `text item delimiters`).\n   - Finally, it places this list of URLs onto the clipboard for the user to use as needed.\n\nIn summary, this script automates the task of collecting all webpage URLs from an open Safari window and copies them to the clipboard, allowing for easy sharing or storage.",
