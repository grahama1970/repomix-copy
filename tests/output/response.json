  "response": "The script `safari-current-window-urls.applescript` is an AppleScript designed for Raycast, a productivity tool on macOS. This script performs the following functions:\n\n1. **Environment**: It uses `osascript`, which allows for running AppleScripts on macOS.\n\n2. **Functionality**: The main purpose of this script is to copy all the URLs from the currently open tabs in the frontmost Safari window to the clipboard.\n\n3. **Process**:\n   - It checks if there is a document (i.e., at least one tab) existing in the frontmost Safari window.\n   - If the document (tab) exists, it collects the URLs of all open tabs within that window.\n   - It then sets the clipboard to contain these URLs, separated by line breaks.\n   - Finally, it logs a message indicating that the URLs have been copied.\n\n4. **Raycast Integration**: The script is integrated into Raycast with metadata that defines its title, mode, package name, and other details for easy usage.\n\nIn summary, the script automates the process of collecting and copying URLs from the active Safari window, making it a handy tool for users who frequently need to gather links quickly.",
